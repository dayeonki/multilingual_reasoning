# prompt from Thought Anchors (https://www.thought-anchors.com/)
classification_prompt = """Instruction: You are an expert in interpreting how Large Language Models solve {{language}} math problems using multi-step reasoning. Your task is to analyze a chain-of-thought reasoning trace, broken into discrete text sentences, and label each sentence with:
1. **function_tags**: One or more labels that describe what this sentence is *doing* functionally in the reasoning process.
2. **depends_on**: A list of earlier sentence indices that this sentence directly depends on, e.g., uses information, results, or logic introduced in earlier sentences.

This annotation will be used to build a dependency graph and perform causal analysis, so please be precise and conservative: only mark a sentence as dependent on another if its reasoning clearly uses a previous sentence’s result or idea.

Function Tags:
1. problem_setup: Parsing or rephrasing the problem (initial reading or comprehension).
2. plan_generation: Stating or deciding on a plan of action (often meta-reasoning).
3. fact_retrieval: Recalling facts, formulas, problem details (without immediate computation).
4. active_computation: Performing algebra, calculations, manipulations toward the answer.
5. result_consolidation: Aggregating intermediate results, summarizing, or preparing final answer.
6. uncertainty_management: Expressing confusion, re-evaluating, proposing alternative plans (includes backtracking).
7. final_answer_emission: Explicit statement of the final boxed answer or earlier sentences that contain the final answer.
8. self_checking: Verifying previous steps, checking calculations, and re-confirmations.
9. unknown: Use only if the sentence does not fit any of the above tags or is purely stylistic or semantic.

Dependencies:
For each sentence, include a list of earlier sentence indices that the reasoning in this sentence *uses*. For example:
- If sentence 9 performs a computation based on a plan in sentence 4 and a recalled rule in sentence 5, then depends_on: [4, 5]
- If sentence 24 plugs in a final answer to verify correctness from sentence 23, then depends_on: [23]
- If there’s no clear dependency use an empty list: []
- If sentence 13 performs a computation based on information in sentence 11, which in turn uses information from sentence 7, then depends_on: [11, 7]

Important Notes:
- Make sure to include all dependencies for each sentence.
- Include both long-range and short-range dependencies.
- Do NOT forget about long-range dependencies.
- Try to be as comprehensive as possible.
- Make sure there is a path from earlier sentences to the final answer.
- ONLY label for the chain-of-thought sentence indices provided in brackets (e.g., [2]).

Output Format:
Return a dictionary with one entry per sentence, where each entry has:
- the sentence index (as the key, converted to a string),
- a dictionary with:
    - "function_tags": list of tag strings
    - "depends_on": list of sentence indices, converted to strings

Here is the expected format:

    "1": {
        "function_tags": ["problem_setup"],
        "depends_on": [""]
    },
    "4": {
